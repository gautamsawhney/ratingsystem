I guess I could think of a few things.\n\nI went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted, while still maintaining the gritty edge of a backwoods Wisconsin eatery.  Let's not get it twisted folks, we're not breaking gastronomic ground here.  What we are breaking are your misconceptions of what a restaurant can be whose parking lot is largely composed of Chevy and Dodge trucks, and whose front, snow-covered, lawn is full of snowmobiles.  Deal with it kids, this is that slice of Midwest Americana you've been looking for in any number of wayside eateries in rural America.  Fish fry anyone?\n\nTo begin, let me explain that one of the many draws for the Beach House's patrons is the fact that it is still legal to smoke indoors in McFarland.  I stepped inside and was immediately made aware of this fact as plumes of smoke took up residence in my clothes and nose.  \n\nDo not fear, however, there is a separate dining room that is nonsmoking.  And man was this separate dining room packed (Superbowl Sunday).  Packed with large women squeezing into convention center chairs.  Packed with waitresses who wore skin tight white Jordache jeans, giving you a fleeting sense of their giving nature.  Packed with the eager anticipation of an entire day spent watching football and football-related activities: drooling, eating, drinking, and smoking.  God bless America.\n\nThe AM dish to get here is the Walleye and eggs breakfast.  I would tend to agree, although their limited selection of omelets is made marginally more tasty by the addition of broccoli (you heard me punk).  As breakfast wore on, the dining room filled, emptied, and filled again; the waitstaff eagerly setting new places, removing paper place settings, calling people darlin' and hon'(always appreciated).\n\nSo give it to me hard backwoods Wisconsin.  Give me every sinew of your being: your ice fishing, snowmobiling, smoking, bloody Mary drinking, being.  Just be.  And give me a friggin' huge piece of deep fried walleye to help me digest the spectacle, with scrambled eggs on the side.

My ratings are relative to my expectations of the experience and in no way relative to other restaurants, (it just isn't fair to use the same scale for a place like the Beach House as you would for The French Laundry so again, it's all relative) \n\nI've only been here for breakfast but the second time I drove a long damn way to have breakfast again so that in and of it self should say something. (another caveat: there are maybe six restaurants in McFarland that don't have drive-thrus)  \n\nI ordered the Walleye and eggs both times along with a bloody mary (gotta love a beer back, yay for Wisconsin). Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that. I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can't get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \n\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\n\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.", "type": "review", "business_id": "_wZTYYL7cutanzAnJUTGMA"}

The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!

That struck me as a very bad sign when I came to Madison almost 20 years ago, and that continues to be the case. The food is insipid, blandly spiced to appeal to unadventurous midwestern tastes and with a menu reminiscent of the Americanized Chinese palaces of the 1950s. I end up there with various groups on occasion, but try to keep it to no more frequent than once every five years (more frequently in my first years in Madison, less so now). It's not that there are vastly superior authentic Chinese options (although I prefer P. F. Chang's, recognizing its limitations), but one does better with other Asian options when in Madison--particularly Thai/Laotian, but also Indian (with many new options in recent years).", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

The food is alright, it's been embellished in a way to appeal to an American audience, but at least the some of the menu choices are pretty real. \n\nMy real problem with this place is the service: The menu was misinforming and didn't specify that some steamed fish dish was a filet as opposed to a whole fish. I politely complained to the waitress about my order not being accurate and she informed her manager. The manager only ended up refunding me 50% off the item ordered and began telling me how you wouldn't refund someone a fancy steak in an expensive restaurant!\n\nIn the end, I paid for my meal and tipped the poor waitress, but I will never visit this place again. I'm not sure if that manager woman was giving me a hard time because I was a young college student or what, but her management skills leave much to be desired.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

The calamari was so stringy that I had to swallow it in one bite because I couldn't separate it with my teeth.  The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\n\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\n\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \n\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\n\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\n\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\n\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\n\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you..

The waitstaff has always been attentive and professional, and the wait time for food is reasonably short. The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\n\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\n\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices. If you're looking for good Chinese in town, check out Hong Kong Cafe on Regent or Orient House on South Park instead.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste, then read on. . .\n\nFor years I have drove by the Imperial Garden and referred to it as the \"Chinese Restaurant Gas Station\". I don't even know if they are connected or what, but you see them both as you turn the corner. We decided to go to this place for Mother's Day and check it out. Talking to friends over the weekend, we were told it was pretty good.\n\nThe building is nice and the atmosphere of the restaurant was way nicer than I expected. Very large and nicely decorated. Not so cheesy like a lot of Chinese-American places in Wisconsin. The hostess greeted us very nicely and having reservations we were seated right away. \n\nNow - we were a larger than average group - table of 8 - but they clearly were set up for groups this big as they had large tables in the corner of the rooms with a spinning lazy susan in the middle that was perfect for us. I think we probably could have even gotten 9 or 10 people on this table. The waitress was very nice too. Came right away and got us drinks and very friendly.\n\nThis is when things went down hill. We did order appetizers, which came out right away. Pot Stickers - both steamed and fried - which were pretty good. Once our whole group arrived we all ordered regular items from their menu. Then we waited. Waited and waited and waited. Apparently so did everyone around us. For hours - over two to be exact. The waitress did her best - kept coming by and telling us she was sorry, that the Kitchen was crazy and that we were next. Honestly we should have left - but it was hard enough getting family members from 4 households together at one time. \n\nEventually the food came out. To their credit, I thought everything tasted pretty good. I got two different shrimp dishes. Decent flavor, cooked perfectly - the snap peas and water chestnuts were good. Portion was decent on the Shrimp dinner and much larger on the chicken dinners that others in my group got. I agree with other reviews - its not the most adventurous food. Flavors were safe and my spicy shrimp wasn't very spicy at all. My sister-in-law was upset her Sesame Chicken with Broccoli came with one piece of broccoli. She complained and the waitress brought out a side of broccoli.\n\nOverall, If the food wasn't pretty good - I would have given this place one star. I give our waitress credit for holding it together too. She offered free desert but we were about an hour late for getting to another place so had to go. Saddest thing is we heard that this has been an ongoing problem with the Kitchen. Sounds like they don't fire dishes in the order they come in and they have a lot of trouble keeping up with things. If they could correct this problem and add a bit more flavor into a few dishes, the place really could be ok.\n\nTry it on your own risk - but I would plan on spending several long hours while you wait for your food.", "type": "review", "business_id": "SKLw05kEIlZcpTD5pqma8Q"}

Hands down, it's the best Chinese I've found so far.  I'd give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.\n\nLike I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It's hard to deviate from that when it's sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or \"questionable\".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \n\nWe don't dine in often or at all.  It's a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That's the way to go here, imho.\n\nTheir location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western 'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. \n\nIf you're looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\n\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you'd normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\n\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I've ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \n\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I'd get it again in a heartbeat!  \n\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you're a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\n\nSo, we'll definitely be back - I'm becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.

Both times the waitstaff has been professional, helpful, and speedy.  The music is at an appropriate level, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor tasteful.  The wine list is extensive, and many dishes on the menu seem appetizing and imaginative at first glance.  With all of these elements going for it, I have high expectations for the food.  Although some of it is delicious, some significant problems have arisen when I've dined there.\n\nI have had both the bruschetta and the mussels as appetizers.  The bruschetta portion was a bit smaller than I expected, but it packs a large amount of flavor into the bites.  The tomatoes tasted fresh and sweet, and balanced well against the (presumably) homemade pesto.  The fresh bread served at the table is similarly warm, with a crisp crust and toothsome interior.  The mussels are flavorful and delicious, but they don't come with any bread to sop up the flavorful broth that remains after the mussels have been eaten.  Our plate was whisked away before we had a chance to ask for any bread to go with the sauce.\n\nTwo of my companions ordered the Ravioli al Vin Santo; both liked and finished the dish.  It is one of four vegetarian options (the Fettucini alla Putenesca does not list meat, but I've never heard of a putanesca sauce made without anchovies), which was a welcome surprise for the vegetarian with whom I dined.  One companion ordered the Insalata di Caesare (which also has unlisted anchovies in the dressing), and found it flavorful, if unimaginative.  A fourth companion ordered the Lasagna del Giorno (that day it was with roasted chicken), and savored every bite.  A fifth companion ordered the Fettucini alla Putenesca, of which I tried a bite.  The spinach fettucini was fresh and delicious, and the sauce was perfectly salty.  My entree, the Campenelli il Diavolillo, was pretty awful.  The combination of meat and seafood in a dish can be done artfully, but this felt like a clumsy mishmash of shrimp, chicken, and Italian sausage.  The sausage was very sweet and seemed to lack enough oregano, basil, and garlic.  It clashed notably with the rest of the dish.  The shrimp and chicken were both cooked well, and were tender and juicy.  The pasta was fresh and tasty.  It was really a shame that the \"spicy garlic broth\" as described by the menu translated into nearly an inch of oil at the bottom of the dish, making the entire dish almost inedible.  All portions were huge.\n\nThe desserts are delicious.  The tiramisu, which I sampled on my first visit, is fluffy and sweet.  I tried to order it on my return visit, but the waitress told me she had sold the last piece to a table that came in after us.  Since we arrived at 5 p.m., this came as quite a shock.  It seems unlikely that they started the evening's service with more than one piece of tiramisu, and seems like profoundly poor planning.  The bread pudding, while not much to look at, is also delicious, though it is so rich that by the time we finished one portion (between three people) it almost felt like i was eating a stick of butter rolled in cinnamon.\n\nI can't say I'll be back anytime soon.  I have to disagree with Zenide R.'s assertion that it's \"easily the best Italian food in the Madison area.\"  For the price, both Lombardino's and Tutto Pasta make better Italian food, and I shall stick to those restaurants in the future.", "type": "review", "business_id": "q8fD82us6uuGufvI44NoAg"}

Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\n\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \n\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous.

Happened to stop there on a Saturday evening at about 5:45p and could not even get in the door because the hostess was blocking the area with a party of four.  Instead of taking the party aside so we could enter, and I should point out I was on crutches, she had us wait outside until she could seat them.  We entered AND STEPPED ASIDE so others could enter.  There were three in a our party.  When she asked if we had reservations, I replied no,  and she commented NO?  You KNOW IT IS SATURDAY.  I wanted to say yes, yesterday was Friday and tomorrow is Sunday.  Instead I replied that I was TERRIBLY sorry i did not realize i needed a reservation, and she once again reminded me it was SATURDAY.  I had never been there and did not realize that it was a quaint, small place.  Had I known, I would certainly made a reservation.  I probably will not make a reservation and try the menu since the hostess obviously thought I did not know what day it was.

For the last year or so the food has been slipping and become mediocre - including, this fall, the worst plate of spaghetti I've ever been served in a restaurant (by an employee who is no longer there), but our experience on Saturday pretty much finished our long relationship with Deli Roma.\n\nWe arrived around 4:30 p.m. and there was no one else in the deli. A young man was seated behind the register and greeted us, but did not get up. We saw the specials board had an item which was a play on the Godfather, their signature Italian roast beef sandwich, and discussed whether we'd want to try it. During all this the gentleman behind the counter remained seated but appeared to be paying attention.\n\nWhen I said we were ready to order he got up, but when I ordered a Godfather he said that they were out of Italian beef. I have worked in restaurants myself and at times you do run out of items, but I don't understand why the specials board carried an item they didn't have and more incomprehensible yet is why he would listen to us talk about the aforementioned special and never bother to mention he couldn't make one anyway. The specials board should have been blank, and more importantly, he should have told us when we came in that they were out of some ingredients.\n\nIf he had, we probably would have stayed and ordered something else, but his attitude projected total, casual indifference in serving us and getting our business.

Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). \n\n*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat. They also offer flautas, I wonder if they're just the same thing.\n\nOther blips in service:\n- served everyone but one person at the table, and took forever to finally bring them their food (soup)\n- we had three kids with our group, and their parents explained they were going to split a meal between the three of them; the waitress didn't bring any extra plates, so we made \"plates\" out of napkins\n\nSo, yeah.

I went there with a friend and business partner I have known for years.\n\nThe non-alcoholic \"tropical\" drink selection had a variety of maybe 10 drinks and they all sounded good.  I had an \"Island Paradise\" - Pineapple and coconut complemented with pomegranate grenadine and a splash of Sprite.  It was very good.\n\nWe ordered a quesadilla appetizer and it was pretty tasty.  There was plenty of chicken, cheese, and vegetables between the tortillas and the portion was just right for us.\n\nWe decided that we would both order something different so that we could share and try other foods on the menu.\n\nI ordered the \"El Cubano\" a traditional Cuban sandwich, made with ham, cheese, roasted pork, pickle and mustard all pressed inside two slices of Cuban bread.  It was average at best.  My friend ordered the BBQ Cheddar Burger and it was excellent.  The burger is just as it sounds, consisting of a bun, beef patty, BBQ sauce cheddar cheese, lettuce and tomatoes, with fried onions.  He gave me half and it was a lot better than the sandwich I ordered.  I did not even finish my half of the Cuban.  My sandwich did come with sweet potato chips which were pretty good.  I am not usually a fan of sweet potato but found myself munching on these chips.\n\nI don't know much about Jimmy Buffett, but the name of this place is actually the title of one of his songs.  There are 38 locations in 17 states, all in places very far from Hawaii.  Maybe it isn't supposed to be like Hawaii, but I feel like it looks like what Hawaii might be envisioned by someone who has never been.  There was no version of the burger made with pineapple slices and teriyaki sauce...but maybe that's because Buffett supposedly wrote \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" in the Carribbean...which changes everything.  Maybe that's why they serve the Cubano, which was still subpar at best.\n\nOverall, the food was satisfactory.  If I am ever in town again or happen to pass by a Cheeseburger in Paradise, I might go back because the drinks are good and the burgers are yummy.  It is a decent meal that won't break your wallet, but take a hint by the restaurant's name and order a cheeseburger.  WWJBD...what would Jimmy Buffett do?  Probably order a Cheeserburger in Paradise, and so should you.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w"}

It seems their buns and meat have changed and the quality is not as good as it had been.  \n\nA disappointing trip, and we likely won't be back anytime soon.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w"}

I was greeted by a revolving door that looked like the windows hadn't been cleaned since the last time Jimmy Buffet was in town.  We were seated at our booth, but before I could slide on in I asked if they would wipe the liquid off of the seat.  I went to the bathroom and washed my hands (the bathroom is another story) When I came back, the liquid was still on the seat of the booth.  The waitress just sluffed off the fact i was agitated by the lack of customer service.  Seriously.  How hard is it to wipe off the booth.\n\nThe food was decent.  Nothing great, but ok.  Portions are weak however.  You'll probably have to venture across the lot to McDonalds for a Big Mac afterward if you want to be full.  A Big Mac would probably be as flavorful as the burgers served here. \n\nWhat irked me about my trip here was the service.  First was the lack of caring when it came to the booth's cleanliness.  Second, I never got a refill on my soda.  For $2.49, I'm sure jimmy could afford another glass of soda.  It took our waitress nearly 10 minutes to collect come back with our bill.  It was like they took my debit card and walked to my bank instead of swiping it to collect payment.\n\nThey get two stars because I didn't have to choke down the food.  However I think I'd rather get in my old car, drive to McDonalds, and risk the chance I get explosive diarrhea before climbing into a sailboat and pointing it toward Cheeseburger In Paradise.", "type": "review", "business_id": "1hBOR97oX5Xph3J8Tdob7w"}

Since they were supposed to close at 11:00 pm we figured it was enough time to eat. When we walked in there were only three other tables of people, one of which was a couple that came in right before us. We waited at the host stand for 3 minutes and finally were greeted by the bartender. He took us to our table and told us our waitress would be with us shortly.  \n\nThe only server left (female, dark brown hair) came over and rushed her greeting by acting annoyed that we were there. She took our order and ran off to start doing the close prep. 5 minutes later she came back to our table and said that the bar was closing (10:30 pm) and that we couldn't get frozen drinks. She asked if we were interested in ordering another type of drink but we declined. She then acted annoyed that we didn't want something other than water! \n\nOur food quickly came out and it was WONDERFUL (thankfully) but our waitress never came back to check on us. I ran out of water and just as I was putting my napkin down she came over with another glass. At that time we asked for our check. We were so mad about the quality of the service that we just wanted to get out of there. We ended up walking out the door at 11:00 pm on the dot! \n\nMy partner and I always tip a min of 20% but often if we like someone we will tip way above. Our service was so terrible that we left her a 15% tip with a note explaining how uncomfortable she made our visit. If she had one ounce of sweetness to her we would've given her 20% BUT she was cold and distant. I understand wanting to get off of work but at least fake a smile and a personality. \n\nI will not be coming back. Yes, the food was amazing BUT bad service equals a no go in my book. Also, why close the bar 30 minutes early???? The drinks are around $8 so do the math on how much you are losing if our table would've ordered 2-4 drinks.

I absolutely love this place and everything on the menu.  When I was a kid the best times were when my father would take an afternoon delivery to the east side and swing by NOTO on the way back.  It was always such a great surprise when my sister and I would be called in for dinner, and right away you could smell those spices!  Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.\n\nI really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  \n\nI've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there.

I wanted to try the dirty rice and was told that I could substitute the regular rice in the Combo for dirty rice. Yes, please!\n\nFirst, I'd like to clarify that the sandwich is NOT as big as other reviews may make it out to be. It's a standard French roll with a standard amount of fillings BUT the flavors are admittedly some of the best I've ever had. The juxtaposition of creamy, tangy sauce with the crunchy, juicy shrimp combined with the fresh lettuce will have you swooning for more.\n\nOn to the combo... What a cornucopia (nods to Candice G.) of beautifully tasty french creole goodness all nestled magically in compartmentalized order without any compartments in the take-out box. It traveled several miles successfully in the manner as well. The warnings of the menu and lady at the counter on the spiciness of the dirty rice and shrimp creole were accurate. It was a flavorful, creeping sort of spice that increased with each bite. Absolutely fantastic.\n\nThe name \"take-out\" is rather misleading because there is ample seating inside the place and many interesting jazz memorabilia to peruse over while eating so eat-in instead of taking-out as the name suggests.\n\nI'll definitely be making a stop here again whenever I'm in the Madison area for some good ol' N'Orleans style cookin'.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw"}

Finally, one day the cravings got to us, so we tried the place out.\n\nThe place was exceptionally easy to order from. They don't play 1,000 questions with you, which is nice. The menu is easy to find online if you don't have a paper copy. \n\nI admit, when I picked up our order and got it home, we were slightly dismayed at the quantity. We ordered two dishes for three people. We spend a lot of time in the Big Easy and have become accustomed to ordering from the locals' joints which cater to the service people. Large portions, cheap prices. \n\nThen we tasted it. We had the large trio (combination of a few things) and it was so good -- the flavors were great, the stuff was actually spicy, and I found I could love jambalaya (normally not a fan).  We also go a shrimp po'boy -- I was so excited that it tasted almost exactly at the one we get from our normal go-to place in the Quarter. \n\nWhile the quantity was less than we expected, the quality was superior to what we get at our little dive joints. You can definitely see they emphasize flavor and texture, rather than giving you a week's worth of food. That works for me -- we were all full off our dishes and very happy.", "type": "review", "business_id": "cpGv6ES2hzPCtCUQgipwXw"}
